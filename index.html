                        <p style="color: #444"> January 2022 - May 2022</p>
                            <span> - Mountain View High School gave me this amazing opportunity to intern at SkillStruck. </span><br> <br>
                           <span> - Skillstruck is a small educational consulting company striving to teach students all throughout America the wonders of programming and technology. <br>
                            To my luck, me and five other students were picked out of hundreds of other applicants. </span>
                            <br> <br> 
                            <span> - My responsibilities were to interact with their software 1-3 hours everyday to spot bugs in their code for improvement. 
                            When I would find an error, I would report that to members of their team to be fixed. </span>
                            <br> <br> 
                            <span> - Myself and the other interns would also participate in weekly meetings to discuss upcoming events.
                            This was my very first quality assurance job working with software. I do believe that I improved dramatically in the field of coding and technology. 
                            I also had the opportunity to develop my Python skills and improve my Javascript! </span>

                            <p style="color: #444"> January 2022 - August 2022</p>
                            <span> - At Fluent Solar I worked as a Technical Support Agent. Monday-Friday, 8 hours a day. </span>
                            <br> <br> 

                            <span> - My everyday duties included working on support tickets, updating them and the customers over phone, email, and text. 
                            I took inbound and outbound calls for these customers and supported their endeavors. </span>
                            <br> <br> 

                            <span> - At this job, I believe I developed the ability to inspect documents and graphs 
                            to solve complex technical issues. I also mastered the ability to de-escalate customers. </span>
